# Welcome to the Test Post

This is a **test blog post** to ensure everything is working correctly.

Here's what we're testing:

- Blog post creation via Sveltia CMS
- Rendering on the frontend
- Deployment on Netlify

## Features Working

âœ… **Markdown rendering**  
âœ… **Frontmatter parsing**  
âœ… **Tags support**  
âœ… **Date formatting**  

## Next Steps

Feel free to add more content here. You can:

1. Create new posts through the admin panel
2. Add images to your posts
3. Use different markdown features
4. Test the tag system

> This is a blockquote to test styling.

**Bold text** and *italic text* work great!

[Links work too](https://example.com)

```javascript
// Even code blocks work!
console.log("Hello, blog!");
```

Happy blogging! ðŸŽ‰
